Problem 1: PayMoney
In this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm. We iterate through the transactions, keeping a running total, and stop when the total is greater than or equal to the target. This approach has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of transactions.

Problem 2: Traveler's Payment
For this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm as well. We sort the currency denominations in descending order and then iterate through them. At each step, we find the maximum number of notes of the current denomination that can be used without exceeding the required amount. We continue this process until the amount becomes zero. This approach also has a time complexity of O(n log n), where n is the number of currency denominations.
